# QR-Error-Reporter
This website provides a QR code–based interface for submitting equipment-related incident reports in a structured way.

When a user scans a posted QR code, the website identifies the specific device based on the ID encoded in the code and displays the corresponding asset information. The user can then access the device’s operating instructions, review a list of frequently asked questions, and submit a fault report for that item. To file a report, the user must provide their name, contact details, the name of the location where the device is installed, and attach at least one photo documenting the issue. After clicking the Submit button, the system sends an email notification to the operator that includes the user’s input together with the device data retrieved from the database for the given system.
